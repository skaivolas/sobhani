# <span id="anchor"></span>Abstract

The present research studies the diminutive forms in English and Arabic
as far as form, morphological process and parts of speech are concerned.
Further, it sheds some light on the meanings of these forms in English
and Arabic. It has been found that the two languages are similar to some
extent with regard to the parts of speech and meanings of these forms.
However, they are drastically different concerning the morphological
process involved. English basically uses suffixation and prefixation
while Arabic depends entirely on infixation where some strict patterns
that are essentially determined by the morphology of the words to be
diminuted are followed.

# <span id="anchor"></span>1 – Introduction:

The term "diminutive forms" refers to the addition of a derivational
suffix, mostly to a noun, which results in a new noun form conveying the
general meaning of 'little' whether literally or metaphorically
(Crystal,

1985:94). For example, 'kitchenette' is a small kitchen and 'booklet' is
a small book. Moreover, the new form is quite capable of expressing the
feeling with which the person or thing referred to is regarded
(Internet). Accordingly, this form can express intimacy, familiarity,
endearment and even lack of respect (Aziz, 1985:145). On the other hand,
in speech this form can be used as a replacement form (Clark \&Clark,
1977:322; Ibrahim, 2003:28). However, mere smallness devoid of some or
any kind of feeling, to some extent, is to be found somewhere else, i.e.
in adjectives like: minute, tiny, few, low, minor, less (Zandvoort,
1972: 302).

Diminutive forms exist in many languages; yet each language has its own
unique way of realizing and expressing these forms. For instance, in
Arabic the diminutive form of 'bāb' (a door) is 'buwayb' (a small door).
Anyhow, the diminutive forms underlie, in one way or another, some
important process of word formation and they are undoubtedly loaded with
a rather wide range of meaning besides smallness, of course.

## <span id="anchor"></span>Aim

Since the diminutive forms exist in many languages, the present research
is crucially intended to compare and contrast these forms in the two
unrelated languages English and Arabic in an attempt to investigate how
they are formed, which morphological process they undergo and which
parts of speech they incorporate. Consequently, some points of
similarity and difference will be highlighted. Moreover, the research is
also expected to shed some light on the meaning (s) these forms impart.

## <span id="anchor"></span>Data Collection

The material which could adequately serve as a basis for the present
research stems largely from some authentic data extracted from many
available relevant references in the two languages under study.

# <span id="anchor"></span>5 . Diminutive Forms in Arabic

Diminutive forms like 'buwayb' (a small door), '’ubayd' (a little
servant) and '’ukhay' (my little brother) occur in Arabic and they are
defined as the forms (mostly nouns) that are derived from other forms
(i.e. nouns) to express many meanings including: smallness, familiarity,
endearment and contempt (An-Nailah, 1988: 270). The morphological
process which the diminutive forms undergo is known as infixation or
minor derivation (Abu-Mughli,1987: 411). Actually, this process involves
the insertion of an affix within the root of a given word (Al-Khuli,
1982: 113; Crystal,1985: 10). In this respect it is of utmost importance
to say that much of the word formation in Arabic takes place internally,
i.e. infixing and modification of the root, rather than the stringing
together of discrete morphemes, are usually the norm (Katamba, 1993:
163). However, such a process is not random, but it follows some fixed
patterns totally in accordance with the morphological structure of any
given form to be diminuted.

Arabic presents a system of consonantal roots most of which are
triliteral, but there are others much smaller in number, which consist
of two or more consonants (Moscati, 1969: 71). In fact this very
structure is the determining factor in the formation of the diminutive
forms on the one hand and the whole process concurrently reveals an
outstanding feature of Arabic, viz. derivation, on the other (As-Salih,
1960: 335). Therefore, the formation of any diminutive form is wholly
governed by whether it is derived from a triliteral root or not.

Most Arab linguists agree that diminutive forms are formed according to
three basic patterns. The first pattern is 'fu'ayl' for the triliteral
root, as in: 'jabal' (a mountain) which is diminuted as 'jubayl' (a
small mountain). The second pattern is 'fu'ay'il' for the quadriliteral
root as in: ''aqrab' (a scorpion) which becomes ''uqayrib' (a small
scorpion). As for the third pattern, it is 'fu'ay'eel' and it is used
with quinqueliteral roots as in: ''usfur' (a sparrow) whose diminutive
form is ''usayfeer' (a small sparrow) (Al-Ghalayīni, 1971: 87; Wright,
1971: 166; Nahr, n.d.:

179; Sībawayhi, 1999: 460).

With regard to meaning, 'Ibn 'Usfūr (1972: 80) states five principal
meanings:

1)  Minimizing the number of something, as in: 'durayhimāt' (few
    dirhams).
2)  Minimizing the status of someone or something, as in: 'shuway'ir (a
    little poet) and 'buwayt' (a small house).
3)  Showing contempt, as in: 'rujail' (a little man).
4)  Approximating of time, as in: 'qubayl' (a little before) and
    'bu'ayd' (a little after).
5)  Approximating of place, as in: 'fuwayq' (a little above).

To these meanings, Al-Ghalayīni (1971: 86) adds the expression of
endearment and affection, as in: 'bunayy' (my little son) and 'sudayq'
(a special male friend). However, Arabic has some words that can convey
the meaning of being small, whether in size or status, as in: 'jānibyy,
far'yy, thānawyy, (secondry) and, 'mu'āwin, musā'id, nā'ib, wakīl'
(assistant).

It is obvious that for the formation of diminutive forms in Arabic, the
morphological structure is immensely important. What is more to be
considered is the part of speech of the word to be diminuted. A close
look at the examples presented above reveals that more than one part of
speech is involved. Therefore, it seems quite convenient at this point
to proceed to discuss the relevant parts of speech in sufficient detail.

## <span id="anchor"></span>5.1 Diminutive Forms and the Parts of Speech

In the formation of diminutive forms, the nouns are prominently
distinguished. However, some other parts of speech are also involved,
namely pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. The first type of nouns that
can be diminuted is the personal proper nouns or names.
<sup>3</sup>Structurally speaking, these nouns have many forms. Let us
first start with the masculine proper nouns.

These nouns can be simple like 'Hamīd', 'Hasan', 'Yahya', ''Adil', or
may be compound as in: ''Abdullāh' and 'Shamsu d-dīn'. It is worth
mentioning in this respect that the compound type has three distinct
forms: the predicative compound which is very rare and it often consists
of a verbal element followed by a nominal one as in: 'Ta'abbata sharran'
and 'Jādal-haqq'(Dawood & Farhan, 1989: 46). The second type of
compounds is manifested by the construct relation as in 'Abdullāh',
where the relation between the components is that of genitive. As for
the third type, it is called the 'fusional' or the mixed compound since
its components are completely fused together as in: 'Sībawayhi' and
'Ma'dikarb', where the relation between the components is either the
same as the latter type or is unknown simply because most of these nouns
are of foreign origin (Kharma & Hajjaj, 1989: 50).

Moreover, masculine proper nouns can have the infinitive form as in:
'Shukr' and 'Ikrām', and some derivative forms, namely the nomen agentis
as in: 'Ādil' and 'Hāmid'; and the nomen patientis as in: 'Mahfūdh' and
'Mas'ūd'. Furthermore, it can even have an adjective form like, 'Sa'īd'
and a verb form like, 'Yahya' (Ghayati, n.d.: 72). Finally, it can have
a feminine termination, as in: ''Utba' and 'Talha'. As far as diminutive
forms are concerned, all these forms of masculine proper nouns can be
diminuted following the three patterns presented earlier. Below are
examples denoting all the types discussed:

Hasan Husayn

Shukr Shukayr

'Ādil 'Udayl

Mahfūdh Muhayfīdh

Sa'īd Su'ayd

It is important to state here that some place proper nouns can be
diminuted as in 'Bu 'aylibak' and 'Hudayrimāw' (Wright, 1971: 169).

Abdullāh 'Ubaydullāh

Ma'dikarb Mu'aydikarb

Mu'away Mu'ayya

<sup>3</sup> . It is important to state here that some place proper
nouns can be diminuted as in 'Bu'aylibak' and 'Hudayrimāw (Wright, 1971:
169).

Yahya Yuhayy

Salmān Sulaymān

Apparently, no example of predicative compounds is detected, i.e. it
does not have a diminutive form, whereas the other two types can be
diminuted where the first part is involved and the second is left
unaltered. Moreover, all the examples presented are in the singular
form, nevertheless the dual as well as all the plural forms are subject
to be diminuted in the same manner. Here are some instances:

Shukayrān Udaylān Husaynūn

Similar to the masculine proper nouns, the feminine proper nouns fall
into many types depending largely on their termination, i.e. whether
they end in 't', 'a' or 'a'. Accordingly, 'Fātima', 'Salmā' , 'Hind' and
'Baydā', can be diminuted as follows: 'Futayma, Sulayma, Hunayda and
Buwayda' (Wright, 1971: 169). Additionally, all the possible dual and
plural forms are subject to be diminuted, as in the following:

Futaymatān Futaymāt

The second type of nouns includes the common count nouns which have
three forms as far as number is concerned and all these forms can be
diminuted.

(ibid: 170). Let us consider the following examples: tall (a hill)
tulayl

’ayn ( an eye ) 'uyayna sadīq ( a male friend ) sudayq sadīqa ( a female
friend ) sudayqa sadīqān (two male friends) sudayqān sadīqatān (two
female friends) sudayqatān sadīqāt (female friends) sudayqāt 'asdiqā'
(male friends) 'usaydiqā'

dūr (houses) duwayrāt

'adlu' (ribs) 'udayli'

'a'mida (pillars ) 'u'aymida

As illustrated above, the examples incorporate all the number forms in
Arabic, i.e. the dual and the various forms of plural.

With regard to the non-count nouns, Wright (ibid: 173) mentions the
following instances:

ta'ām (food) tu'aym

dam (blood) dumay

mā' (water) muway

Another type of nouns that can restrictedly be diminuted is the numerals
starting from three to ten as in the following:

Khamsu (five, showing feminine gender) khumays Khamsatu (five, showing
masculine gender) khumaysatu

The infinitive is not exempted from being diminuted. Thus 'wa'd'
(promise) can be diminuted as (wu'ayd) and ''atā' 'a gift' as ''utay'
(ibid)

In addition to all these types of nouns, some derivative nouns, the
nomen agentis and the nomen patientis can have diminutive forms as in
the following examples:

rāfi' (raising) ruwayfi'

fāris (a horse man) fuwayris mansūr (victorious) munaysīr maktūb
(written) mukaytīb

Adjectives constitute the second part of speech that can be diminuted as
shown below:

jamīl (beautiful) jumayl mayyit (dead) muyayt

sha'ik (bristling) shuwayk

It is commonly known that adjectives in Arabic share many features with
nouns, namely number and gender. Consequently, all the resulting forms
can be equally diminuted as demonstrated below:

jamīla (beautiful, denoting a feminine gender) jumayla

jamīlatān (beautiful, denoting a dual number) jumaylatān jamīlāt (
beautiful, denoting feminine plural) jumaylāt

The third part of speech that can be diminuted includes pronouns; to be
precise, some demonstrative and relative pronouns (Al-Hamalāwi, 1965:
31; Ghayati, n.d.: 73-74). The demonstrative pronouns involved include
the following:

dhā (referring to masculine singular) dhayā

dhān (referring to masculine dual) dhayān

ta (referring to feminine singular) tayā

tān (referring to feminine dual) tayān 'ulae (referring to masculine and
feminine plural) 'uliya'

As for the relative pronouns, Al-Hamalāwi (1965: 31) states the
following:

’alladhi (referring to masculine singular) ’alladhiya ’allātī (referring
to feminine singular) ’allatiya ’alladhān (referring to dual masculine)
’alladhayān ’allatān (referring to dual feminine ) ’allatayān
’alladhīn (referring to plural masculine) ’alladhiyoon.

It is noticeable in this type that only the second part of the word is
diminuted

(Sībawayhi, 1999: 540).

The last part of speech in this concern is the adverbs (Wright, 1971:
167). However, only some adverbs of time and place are included as shown
in the examples below:

qabl (before) qubayl

ba'd (after) bu'ayd

fawq (above) fuwayq

dūn (below) duwayn

Despite the obvious fact that the diminutive forms in Arabic are rather
extensive, in the sense that they comprise a large number of the parts
of speech, sometimes they are completely not admitted or they are
blocked. Al-Hamalāwi (1965: 31) clearly presents these cases which
include the following: the Attributes of Almighty Allah, the Attributes
of the Prophet (PBUH), the Holy Books, the Holy Places, the names of the
days, and months. Moreover, verbs, letters, some words like 'kull, ba'd,
ghayr, siwā, sawā'' and predicative compounds as well are all not
admitted.

# <span id="anchor"></span>6. Comparison of Diminutive Forms in English and Arabic

Having presented the diminutive forms in both English and Arabic, it can
be said that each language has its own unique way of constucting these
forms. English has evidently shown an uncontroversial tendency to
implement two distinct morphological processes, i.e. suffixation and
prefixation. As for the first process, eight suffixes are distinguished,
five of which, namely '–een, -erel, -et, -ette and –let' are often
attached to common nouns in particular, whereas the other three, i.e.
'-ie, -kin, and – ling' are equally added to proper and common nouns.
Moreover, '–ling' can be added to verbs and '-ie' to adjectives.

As far as prefixes are concerned, they surpass suffixes in number on the
one hand and in being attached to more than one part of speech,

i.e. nouns, adjectives and verbs, on the other. More specifically, the
prefixes 'mono-, semi- , sub- and uni 'are mostly combined with both
nouns and adjectives, whereas 'under' can further combine with verbs. On
the other hand, the remaining prefixes are exclusively combined with
nouns. It is worth mentioning that some suffixes can combine with proper
nouns as is the case with '–ie' and 'kin', but such a case is not
detected concerning prefixes.

In respect of meaning, diminutive forms in English usually show
smallness, endearment, familiarity and, very rarely, contempt.

On the other hand, in Arabic the diminutive forms are expressed and
realized by following some fixed or rather strict procedures, i.e.
patterns that are unlikely be violated. In this respect, three clear-cut
patterns are identified according to the morphological structure of any
word to be diminuted. In other words, it is the root,whether it be
triliteral

or not, which determines which pattern is applicable. These patterns
are: fu'ayl, fu'ay'il and fu'ay'īl. The morphological process involved,
here, is referred to as infixation since an internal change is actually
taking place.

It is notable that the diminutives forms in Arabic incorporate a wide
range of parts of speech. Besides adjectives, some adverbs, some
pronouns and all nouns, irrespective of number, gender and whether it is
count or non – count can freely be diminuted in accordance with the
patterns stated before. Nevertheless, some diminutive forms are not
admitted at all. Conversely, in English only some parts of speech can be
diminuted, i.e. the singular number of the proper and count nouns is
only pointed out. Furthermore, not many instances of diminuted
adjectives and verbs are revealed. No instance of a non-count noun is
detected.

As for meaning, the diminutive forms in Arabic have shown a plethora of
meaning not merely expressing smallness, endearment and familiarity but
also contempt, approximating of time and place and minimizing of number
and status.

# <span id="anchor"></span>Conclusion

From the preceding discussion, it becomes clear that the diminutive
forms in English can be produced either by suffixation or prefixation
where only some parts of speech are included to express some affective
meanings. On the other hand, these forms in Arabic are exclusively
produced by infixation where many parts of speech are involved to
express, to a large extent, many other meanings besides smallness.
