# **Introduction**

Allocutive agreement refers to representing the gender of an addressee
in utterances (Haddican, 2018; Kaur, 2018; Miyagawa, 2017). Allocutivity
is extensively studied across languages: Punjabi (Kaur, 2018), Glician
(Riobóo, 1995), Japanese (Miyagawa, 2017), Jingpo (Zu, 2013), and Basque
(Haddican, 2018). The following examples illustrate the phenomenon.

1)   *Amaia n-a-u-k.*

Amaia ABS.1SG-PRES-have-ALL.MASC

I am Amaia (to a male addressee, speaking informally)

2)  *Amaia n-a-u-n*.

Amaia ABS.1SG-PRES-have-ALL.FEM

I am Amaia (to a female addressee, speaking informally)

Allocutive agreement appears in how speech participants show agreement
with the addressee. In ‎(1), the marker -*k* depicts a male addressee.
However, if the addressee is a female, the *-n* appears instead ‎(2).
Allocativity appears in various constructions in the Arabic language and
its spoken varieties. We often observe instances of multiple agreement
patterns with the addressee. Agentive addressee and non-agentive ones in
religious transcripts\[2\] ‎(3).

3)  *ʔa-raʔay-ta-**ka*** *hā-ḏā* *ʔal-laḏi* *karram-ta* *ʕalā-yya*?

‘Did you YOU see the person that you preferred over me?’

*baġta*?

‘Did you YOU see if God’s torture besieged you suddenly.’

> (Holy Quran)

Two morphemes depict the addressee in the examples above. In ‎(3), -*ta*
and -*ka* are second person singular morphemes. The structure of these
morphemes is sensitive to the gender and number of the second person; in
‎(4), they change to reflect a plural second person. Despite its
importance, none of the studies has examined allocutivity in the Arabic
language. There are two reasons for ignoring this phenomenon. First,
allocutivity is often depicted through multifunctional exponents; that
is, allocutive morphemes perform more than one function, depending on
their syntactic context. Without a contextual-functional analysis
(Wiltschko, 2014), it is impossible to arrive at allocutive patterns.
Second, in functional categories, allocutivity appears as bounded
affixes; they are inseparable from the interpretation of their host;
without a thoughtful scrutinization, it is tempting to submerge
allocativity within the structure of such categories. The case resembles
that of Basque (Haddican, 2018).

5)  *Hi-k egin-go d-u-k/-n.*

you-ERG do-IRR EXPL-ROOT-2SG.FAM.ERG.MASC/FEM

‘You (familiar) will do it.’

6)  *Hi-ri eman-go d-i-a/na-t*.

you-DAT give-IRR
EXPL-ROOT-2[SG.FAM.MASC/FEM.DAT](http://sg.fam.masc/FEM.DAT)-1SG.ERG

‘I will give it to you.’

The bottom-line that sets allocutivity apart from other functions is
that allocutive exponents refrain from having thematic roles; they,
instead, show pragmatic roles (Speas & Tenny, 2003). In this paper, we
show that this is exactly what goes in the Arabic language. Second
person exponents are two types: exponents that show thematic roles and
exponents that show pragmatic roles. We provide evidence that the former
exists in thematic domains while the latter shows up in speech act
domains.

Even though the literature (Aoun et al., 1994; Benmamoun, 2011; Fehri,
2012, among others), examine -ak as a pronominal suffix that competes
for genitive, oblique and accusative case, depending on the category it
attaches to, the study highlights several cases in which the suffix
cannot be treated according to previous treatments. The following table
illustrates Benmamoun (2011) classification of -k.

**Table** **1 The Classification of *-k* in Benmamoun's (2011, p.
145-146) analysis**

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</table>

The classification above deals with how the marker -k is defined
relative to verb, nouns, and prepositions. Thus, -k is viewed, based on
these contexts, as a pronominal suffix. Benmamoun (2011) classification
characterizes -k behavior in well-known contexts. He (2011, p.146)
claims that “object clitics are not sensitive to the category type and
to aspectual or temporal properties of the head that hosts them.”
However, the classification above overlooks other contexts - the
contexts in which -k serves as an allocutive marker.

The discussion is organized as follows. Section two provides a brief
introduction to allocativity and speech act projections. Section three
describes the multifunctionality of allocutive morphemes in Arabic and
how they challenge agreement approaches (e.g., Benmamoun, 2011; Fassi
Fehri, 2012). Section four proposes an analysis of these markers as
bound morphemes that are merged in a speech act projection. Section five
extends the analysis to capture analogs patterns at the morphosyntactic
level: DPs and DemPs. We show the decomposition of the pronominal system
in Arabic.

# **Background**

The development in syntactic theories has shown that there are two ways
in which the addressee interacts with syntactic structures: agentive and
non-agentive addresses (Antonov, 2015). The non-agentive addressee is
present by a class of morphemes that are called allocutive markers
(Haddican, 2018). In Basque, speakers may use allocutivity with finite
verbs in two occasions: familiarity and politeness. Based on that, there
are two allocutive pronouns in the language *hi* and *zu*. Both pronouns
feature a second person; nevertheless, *hi* shows familiarity, and *zu*
expresses respect (Antonov, 2015, p. 56).

7)  *Bilbo-ra n-oa*
    
    Bilbao-ALL 1.S-go
    
    ‘I am going to Bilbao.’

8)  *Bilbo-ra n-oa-k*
    
    Bilbao-ALL 1.S-go-ALLOC:M
    
    ‘I am going to Bilbao.’ \[male addressee\]

9)  *Bilbo-ra n-oa-n.*

Bilbao-ALL 1.S-go-ALLOC:F

‘I am going to Bilbao.’ \[female addressee\]

10) *etʃe-a banu-sy.*

> house-ALL 1.S.go-ALLOC:RSP

‘I am going to the house.’ \[respected addressee\]

(Antonov, 2015, pp. 57–58)

According to Antonov (2015), the allocutive markers, *-k* *‎*(8) and
*-n* ‎(9), show that the speaker is familiar with addressee. In ‎(10),
the speaker uses the allocutive morpheme -sy as a politeness strategy to
code respect for the addressee.

Recently, researchers have proposed models for understanding how the
language faculty generates allocutivity. The new models necessitate
creating syntactic projections that can assign pragmatic roles. Reviving
Ross' (1970) performative hypothesis, Speas and Tenny (2003) show that,
in addition to including thematic domains, syntactic projections have
domains for assigning pragmatic roles. Addressees may function as
arguments if they are generated in thematic domains; they may lose this
function if they are generated in the pragmatic domain. The basic
insight has led to a further articulation of complementizer phrases;
according to their view, pragmatic domains must c-command thematic ones;
that is, speech act projections must be the maximal projection for
complementizer phrases.

11) 
Speech act projections work on the basis of two layers to capture speech
participants: the speaker layer and the hearer layer (Haegeman & Hill,
2013; Hill, 2007b, 2013a). Haegeman and Hill (2013) show how the speech
act zone impacts particles and vocatives, Alcazar and Saltarelli (2013)
create a link between this zone and imperatives, Gutzmann (2019) draws
similar conclusions on its impact on expressivity and Wiltschko and Heim
(2016) confirms its existence by looking at its role in grounding. The
most agreed-upon pattern is seen in ‎(12) below.

12) 

> ![](media/image1.emf)

Among the many syntactic patterns that can relate to the speech act
zone, allocutivity is related to how the hearer is depicted in syntactic
derivations such as CPs (Haegeman & Hill, 2013), DPs (Ritter &
Wiltschko, 2018), DemPs (Bliss & Wiltschko, 2014) and others.

# Analysis

Cross-linguistically, allocutivity includes a second person feature and
resembles second person pronouns; however, they do not appear in
argument positions. To establish the foundation of allocutivity in the
Arabic language and its spoken varieties, we present a comparative
approach that highlights the role of allocutive markers in CPs, DPs,
DemP, and PartPs. We present that in all these constructions,
allocutivity serves pragmatic functions such as establishing emphasis,
imperative force, exposing proximity relations, and others. The
comparison shows that in these constructions, the second person marker
does not have any argument position; that is, it does not function as a
subject or object.

## 

## Allocutive Markers above CPs

The analysis shows that there is a need to distinguish between addressee
at two syntactic levels. The first level predicts that the addressee has
the thematic role of an agent, whereas the second level indicates that
the addressee has the pragmatic role of a hearer. The prediction
supports the contrasts of spelling out two specifiers. We provide a
clear case where the specifier positions from the lowest part of the
syntactic derivations, vP up to the highest-level, SAP. Consider the
following example.

13) *ʔa-raʔay-ta-ka* *hā-ḏā* *ʔal-laḏi* *karram-ta* *ʕalā-yya*?

<span class="smallcaps">q.part</span>-saw-<span class="smallcaps">2m.sg-2m.sg
part-dem</span> <span class="smallcaps">def</span>-that

‘Did you **YOU** see the person that you preferred over me?’

(Holy Quran)

14) *ʔa-raʔay-tu-kum ʔin ʔatā-kum ʕaḏāb-u Allah-i baġta?*
    
    <span class="smallcaps">q.part</span>-saw-<span class="smallcaps">2m.pl-2m.pl</span>
    if came-<span class="smallcaps">2m.pl.acc</span>

    God-<span class="smallcaps">gen</span> suddenly
    
    <span class="smallcaps">‘</span>Did you **YOU** see if God’s torture
    besieged you suddenly.’

(Holy Quran)

The question in ‎(13) shows a complex representation of the addressee
that can be decoded only at the syntactic-pragmatic interface. The verb
*raʔay-ta-ka* ‘you show’ is suffixed by two markers of you, -*ta* and
-*ka*; the two markers, nevertheless, refer to the same addressee. The
only difference is that the first marker, -*ta* is an articulation of
the covert agent, while the second marker -*ka* does not function as an
agent. The order of morphemes shows that they are syntactically
governed; the suffix -*ta* must come before the suffix -*ka*

15) a. *ʔa-raʔay-ta-ka*

> b.\**ʔa-raʔay-ka-ta*

16) a. *ʔa-raʔay-tu-kum*

> b.\**ʔa-raʔay-kum-tu*

The syntactic difference pours out naturally from their hierarchical
order; the agentive you (-*ta*/-*tu*) is closer to the verb than the
non-agentive you (-*ka*/-*kum*). This entails where thematic and
pragmatic roles are realized in syntactic structures.

The first stage, in deriving the structure of *you YOU*, begins with
deriving the CP structure. The verb merges with its specifier\[3\].
After the verb moves to T, it gets its past interpretation. Then, the
verb moves to C to be associated with the interrogative force; C is
specified by the interrogative particles *ʔa*. The derivation below
clarifies the first stage.

17) 
![](media/image2.emf)

The same mechanism applies to moving the agentive -*ta* after
associating it with its thematic role in the VP position. -*ta* moves to
occupy the specifier position of little v before moving to the specifier
position of T to satisfy the EPP feature in T. -*ta* is blocked from
further movements because the interrogative particle occupies the next
landing target,
<span class="smallcaps">spec</span>-<span class="smallcaps">c</span>.
The movement can be illustrated in ‎(18) below.

18) 

![](media/image3.emf)

The second stage in the derivation is to account for the non-agentive
-*ka*. Assuming that -*ka* represents the hearer and arguing that -*ka*
is disassociated from any thematic roles and is associated with
pragmatic roles instead confirms its status in SAPs; that is, -*ka*
occupies the specifier position of the hearer projection ‎(19).

19) 

![](media/image4.emf)

The -*ka* appears in a c-commanding position higher than the CP.
Therefore, -*ka* cannot get any thematic roles, yet it exists in a
position where a second-person feature is present (Hill, 2007b, 2013a).

20) 

![](media/image5.emf)

This fact explains why only -*ka* appears in this position but not any
corresponding third-person markers, such as -*hu*. Notice that using -hu
as an addressee is not permissible; instead, the grammatical role of
-*hu* in ‎(21) is the direct object. Therefore, since the verb *see* is
a monotransitive verb, using -*hu* along with another object yields to
ungrammatical construction‎(22).

21) a. \**ʔa-raʔay-ta-hu* \[intended for an addressee\]

b. *ʔa-raʔay-ta-hu* \[-*hu* is the direct object\]

22) *\*ʔa-raʔay-ta-hu* *hā-ḏā* *ʔal-laḏi* *karram-ta* *ʕalā-yya*?

<span class="smallcaps">q.part</span>-saw-<span class="smallcaps">2m.sg-3m.sg.acc
part-dem</span> <span class="smallcaps">def</span>-that
prefered-<span class="smallcaps">2sg</span>
on-<span class="smallcaps">1sg</span>.<span class="smallcaps">acc</span>

‘Did you **YOU** see the person that you preferred over me?’

If -*ak* is in a c-commanding position, the derivation in ‎(20) would
fail to account for the right word order. Since the interrogative
particle is directed by a speaker and as the specifier position of the
speaker is still vacant, we argue that the CP moves to
<span class="smallcaps">spec-sap,</span> yielding the following outcome.

23) 
![](media/image6.emf)

The outcome is that -*ka* ends in the rightmost position after the verb
and its agentive suffix -*ta* and object, without having any thematic
roles. The allocutive agreement, in Japanese, provides ample evidence
for such movement (Miyagawa, 2017). The prediction can be generalized to
support the existence of allocutive markers/agreement in Arabic and its
spoken varieties, a matter that is overlooked in all previous treatments
(e.g., Benmamoun, 2003, 2011; Fassi Fehri, 2012, among others). The
pragmatic motivation for using *you YOU* is to establish an emphasis
that is integrated with an imperative reminder for the addressee. The
question is a rhetorical question; that is, the speaker does not wait
for the addressee to answer his inquiry; instead, he is emphasizing and
highlighting the speech act of reprimand on his behalf. We, therefore,
argue that rhetorical questions are questions established when the
specifier of C moves to the specifier of the position of the speaker's
head. The conclusion has fruitful outcomes; information-seeking
questions differ from rhetorical ones in that the latter involves more
emphasis on the addressee; while the force of both types is established
in C, C does not have any further impact on their interpretations.

## Allocutive Markers in DemPs

If the syntax of SAPs is well-established in Classical Arabic, we should
observe its impact on the structure of CPs, DemPs, and DPs. While we
illustrate the former, we provide further evidence to its structure in
DemPs and DPs. <span dir="rtl"> </span> In Classical Arabic, the
interpretation of demonstratives is opaque. The demonstrative *ðalika,*
for instance, is often glossed as ‘that’. However, the demonstrative is
not always interpreted as a distal marker; decomposing the demonstrative
shows an interaction with the addressee marker *-ak*. The impact of the
addressee marker reverses the commonly held view that the demonstrative
should point to distal objects; instead, its use entails proximity
‎(24).

24) *ðālika* *ʔal-kitab lā raybba fī-hi* …
    
    this <span class="smallcaps">def</span>-book no doubt
    in-it.<span class="smallcaps">gen</span>

‘This book is undoubtful.” (Holy Quran)

I attribute the proximity of the interpretation to the structure of the
demonstrative itself ‎(25); *ðalika* may be decomposed into three parts:
*ða-li-ka* \[DEM-li-2<span class="smallcaps">m.sg\].</span> Because of
the addressee marker, I argue that *ða* \[DEM\] depicts proximity. The
speaker is not only pointing toward the book but also implying a command
for a nearby addressee. The book is far from the speaker, indicated by
-*li*, but it is close to the hearer. The decomposition may provide
further evidence for the impact of speech acts at the morphosyntactic
level (Marantz, 1997), confirming the similarity between CPs, DPs, and
DEMPs (Bliss & Wiltschko, 2014, 2018; Clark et al., 1983; Wiltschko,
2014c).

25) 

![](media/image7.emf)

It is observed that, in some languages such as Punjabi (Kaur, 2018), the
allocutive marker is realized as the cogwheel of the imperative
interpretation. In DEMPs, the allocutive marker changes the spatial
deictic interpretation. The behavior of other closely related
demonstratives such as *haðak* ‘that’ provides a full articulation of
the specifier position of the speaker; the demonstrative may be
decomposed into three elements \[*ha*-DEM-2.SG\]. *ha-* represents a
marker through which the speaker is drawing the hearer’s attention
‎(26).

26) 

![](media/image8.emf)

In line with the finding, a potential area of research is to explore the
impact of the allocutive marker on other demonstratives and opaque
categories and figure out its influence on their interpretation.

## Allocutive Markers in DPs

Abney (1987) shows that there is a parallel between CPs and DPs. Ritter
and Wiltschko (2018) argue that SAPs are not limited to CPs, but they
can also be found in DPs. The analysis of -*ak* as an allocutive
morpheme in Arabic supports their conclusions. The following example is
illustrative.

27) ʔ*iyyaka naʕbd-u wa ʔiyyāka nastʕīn*.

<span class="smallcaps">indef.pro:2m.sg.acc</span>
worship.<span class="smallcaps">1pl</span>-<span class="smallcaps">pres</span>
and <span class="smallcaps">indef.pro:2m.sg.acc</span>
seek-help.<span class="smallcaps">1pl</span>

‘It is You we worship, and it is You we ask for help.’

We depart from previous treatments of *ʔiyaka* as a pronoun that
consists of one unit. *-ka* only represents the second person
specifications, while *ʔiya* itself does not. Both affixes are
inseparable; they are bound morphemes. Therefore, in this domain -*ka*
cannot have any thematic roles of its own. However, we notice that as
one-unit, *ʔiyaka* is having the accusative case and acts as the
grammatical object of its c-commanding verbs ‎(28).

28) \[<span class="smallcaps">focp</span> *iyyaka*
    \[<span class="smallcaps">foc</span>
    \[<span class="smallcaps">cp</span>
    …\[<span class="smallcaps">vp</span> *pro*
    \[<span class="smallcaps">v</span> naʕbd-u
    <span class="smallcaps">DP</span>~~\[iyaka\]~~\]

Our prediction suggests that the pronoun is breakable, yet it is
inseparable. This suggests that DP is morphosyntactically complex; it is
c-commanded by a SAP. Our initial analysis can be presented as follows.

29) ![](media/image9.emf)

In (17), the indefinite pronoun originates in the D position; however,
since the DP is related to the addressee, it moves to a position to be
specified by the allocutive marker (via an agreement with addressee or
via affixation to the allocutive morpheme). Based on the analysis, the
indefinite interpretation is clarified by specifying the gender and
number of the addressee. The pronoun is used to emphasize the addressed
entity.

The suggested idea highlights another puzzle. The Arabic pronominal
system classifies *ʔiyaka* as an accusative pronoun and lists another
functional akin pronoun as an agentive one. Thus, the system
differentiates two pronouns that stand for the second person: *ʔiyaka*
and ʔ*anta* and their derivatives as follows.

30) *ʾiyāka* \[m.sg\] *ʾiyāki* \[f.sg\], *ʾiyākumā* \[n.du\], *ʾiyākum*
    \[m.pl\], *ʾiyākun* \[f.pl\]

31) *ʾanta* \[m.sg\], *ʾanti* \[f.sg\], *ʾantumā* \[n.du\], *ʾantum*
    \[m.pl\], *ʾantuna* \[f.pl\]

> The pronouns show sharp contrast at two levels. The first level is
> that the pronouns in ‎(30) can have an imperative force when they are
> used by themselves, while the pronouns in ‎(31) cannot.

32) *ʾiayāka w al-kaḏib*.

2m.sg.imp and def-lie

‘you must not to lie.’

‘I warn you not to lie.’

> Another contrast appears with how *ʾiyyā* can detach from -*ka*.
> *ʾiyyā* can attach with third-person bound pronouns. Once they
> detach from their second person markers, they behave differently. They
> lose the ability to imply imperative force. Besides, ʾiyyaā can show
> the speaker.

33) *ʾiyyāhu* \[m.sg\], *ʾiyāhā* \[f.sg\], *ʾiyāhmā* \[n.du\], *ʾiyāhm*
    \[m.pl\], *ʾiyāhn* \[f.pl\]

34) ʾiyāya \[sg\], ʾiyānā \[pl\]

We assume that *ʾiyyā* is a DP by itself. The difference lies in how the
DP depicts its internal structure. -*ka* represents the articulation of
the hearer specification ‎(30)and -*ya* and -*na* *‎*(34) depicts the
specification of the speaker. The third person patterns confirm the
agentive specifications ‎(33). The logical patterns confirm the status
of *ʾiyyā* as a unit of language that has its own boundary.

We argue that these pronouns consist of internal structure. As I
illustrated earlier, *ʔiyyaka* consists of the indefinite marker,
*ʔiyya,* and the allocutive marker -*ka*. As it stands the *ʔiyyaka*
cannot appear in the agentive position; we attribute the reason to the
fact that -*ka* does not have any thematic roles. By analogy, ʔ*anta*
and its derivatives ‎(31) consist of two bound morphemes: ʔ*an* and
*-ta*. The prediction highlights why ʔ*anta* albeit specified with a
second person feature like *ʔiyyaka* it must always appear in the
agentive position. Our analysis predicts that *ʔan* is formed in a
similar way like *ʔiyyaka*; however, it is specified by the agentive
-*ta* which associates with ʔ*an* at an earlier stage. The stage is akin
to the specifier position of the VP, where thematic roles are assigned.
Thus, ʔ*anta* is derived as follows.

35) 
![](media/image10.emf)

The analysis shows that the system of the Arabic language consists of
three major categories: nouns, verbs and particles. What originates in
the d position and gets new interpretations are, in fact, particles; the
functional head defines the particles. Their specification with agentive
and non-agentive addressee markers define their use and position. Thus,
those particles that originate in the d position and are c-commanded by
the hearer never appear in the agentive position, but those that are
associated with the agentive markers can appear as agents.

## Allocutive Markers in Imperative NoVs

We push the prediction that the Arabic language has only particles and
show how particles can be disguised in *ʔisim ʔal-fiʕil* ‘Names of
Verbs’. In the Arabic language, prepositions can appear to function as
verbs, and they withhold commands for their hearers.

36) *haaka al-kitaab-a*.

<span class="smallcaps">part</span>:<span class="smallcaps">2m.sg</span>
<span class="smallcaps">def</span>-book-<span class="smallcaps">acc</span>.

‘Take the book.’

37) *dūnka al-qalam.*
    
    part:2m.sg def-pen
    
    ‘take the pen.’

We argue that the derivation of this category follows from the same
principle; the particle in the V position acts as a verb and may end up
like verbs. However, once the particle moves to the speech act zone; it
behaves differently; in that position, the particle internally merges
with a specifier that does not have a thematic role; that is, the
particle gets specified by a hearer. The representation below
illustrates a shortcut for the movement process.

38) ![](media/image11.emf)
    
    Pragmatic reasons, more specifically emphasis, trigger the movement
    of the particle; in its original position the particle will move the
    C position for generating the imperative force; like in English, the
    C position is specified by a generic *you*; the generic *you* cannot
    specify precisely the entity addressed. Therefore, the particle
    moves higher up to a position that enables a more accurate
    interpretation of the imperative force; the new landing site should
    confirm the gender and number of the hearer. The SAP singles the
    hearer out and specifies its gender and number by the allocutive
    marker -*ka* and its derivatives.

39) ![](media/image12.emf)

The prediction provides evidence for the role of allocutive markers in
imperative interpretations. Kaur (2018) shows that Punjabi, an
Indo-Aryan language, deploys allocutive markers, such as -*je*, with
declarative verbs for endowing such verbs with imperative force.

Kaur (2018) shows that allocativity is the primary source for the
impetrative interpretation in ‎(41). We also conclude that what endows
particles and DPs with imperative force is their association with
allocutive markers.

## Allocutive Markers in Imperative Calls

One of the most recent areas in syntactic literature has focused on the
syntactic structure and the functional composition of call constructions
(Hill, 2007a, 2013b, 2017). Across languages, establishing a call on
addressee is mostly done by vocative particles (Hill, 2007a) or by
intonation (Heim et al., 2016). In the Arabic language, vocatives are
not exceptional. According to (Moutaouakil, 1989, among others), there
are eight vocative particles: *ʔa*, *ʔaj*, *jā*, *ʔaja*, *haja*, *ʔaj*,
*ʔa,* and *wa*. Most particles appear along with an addressee. Most
studies have focused on dealing with calls established by using the
particle *jā* (Shormani & Ali Qarabesh, 2018). Most recent generative
treatments of vocatives predict that a vocative construction consists of
an optional vocative particle that occupies the specifier position of a
vocative head (Espinal, 2011; Hill, 2007, 2013a), schematized in (233)
below. Soltan (2016) shows the applicability of this model in generating
vocatives in Arabic.

According to Soltan (2016), in Egyptian Arabic, the vocative particle is
obligatory with nouns and adjectives and is prohibited with
second-person pronouns and definite DPs. The distribution of the
vocative particle, in Egyptian Arabic, shows that vocative particles
cannot be used with pronouns.

43) \**jā ʔinta*.

<span class="smallcaps">voc</span> you

‘hey, you.’

However, in spoken varieties of Arabic, such as Omani Arabic, speakers
create a call by using the call particle *ja* along with the second
person; more specifically, in Omani Arabic, speakers use *jaak* \[
vocative particle + second person\] to establish a warning call on
addressee (Lutz & Jong, 2011). The pattern suggests that the vocative
particle gets an imperative force once the allocutive marker attaches to
it. See the following example.

44) jāk wī ʔil-lis.

<span class="smallcaps">part.2m.sg</span>
<span class="smallcaps">part</span>
<span class="smallcaps">def</span>-thief (Omani Arabic)

‘watch out for the thief\!’ (Lutz & Jong, 2011, p. 486)

The prediction shows a neat interaction between syntactic outputs and
pragmatic motivations. When a call is established in typical situations,
it is fully-fledged with a vocative particle and an addressee. Strong
calls are more urgent and direct. We conclude that what enables the
imperative interpretation of calls is their association with allocutive
markers.

# **Conclusion**

This research presents data in favor of allocativity in Arabic. We have
highlighted contexts in which second person markers do not have an
agentive role; instead, they show pragmatic ones. The pragmatic roles of
the second person markers qualify them to be interpreted as allocutive
morphemes. The first pattern appears where agentive and non-agentive
markers are used in one domain; the appearance of the two markers
highlighted the syntactic position and role of allocativity in Arabic.
We extended the analysis to capture allocativity at the morphosyntactic
compositions of DPs, DemPs, PartPs and VocPs. The remarkable behavior of
allocativity confirms the views that SAPs are the topmost c-commanding
layer of nominal projections(Ritter & Wiltschko, 2018) and demonstrative
phrases (Bliss & Wiltschko, 2014), which gives direct support for the
Universal Spine Hypothesis (Wiltschko, 2014). The study also finds that
allocativity in Arabic serves several pragmatic functions: it can
establish imperative force, emphasis, and proximity. The principle that
governs allocutive markers is how functional heads attach to roots and
their level of association.

    important for grounding the phenomenon in everyday use of the
    language; using a language covers the ability of its native speakers
    to decode messages. We extend the analysis to everyday language
    throughout the study.
