The Syntax of Sudden Particles in Arabic

Abstract

Arabic language forms conditional structures using particles such *ʔɪða*
‘if’ and *law* ‘if’. At their surface level, these particles seem to
form conditional structures.

1)  **ʔɪða** ʤaʔ-a ʔalj-un qul l-i

> if came Ali-NOM tell-me
> 
> ‘If Ali comes, tell me.’

2)  ***law*** ʤaʔ-a ʔalj-un l-raʔajtu-hu

> if came Ali-NOM to-see-him
> 
> ‘If Ali came, I should have seen him.’

At the morphosyntactic level, the use of these particles involves a
level of opacity. The particles may depart from their conditional
function; speakers may deploy them to indicate a sudden realization of
an action. Consider the following examples.

3)  laqj-tu zajd-an w **ʔɪða** ʕab-du ʔallah-i jaᴅrɪbu-hu

> met-I Zaid-ACC and if Abdullah-GEN hit-him
> 
> ‘I met Zaid and suddenly, I saw that Abdullah is hitting him.’

4)  f-ʔaqa-ha f-**ʔɪða** hɪja ħaja-tun tasʕa

> drop-it f-if it-3SG.F snak-NOM PROG-live
> 
> ‘he dropped it and suddenly it became a living snake’.

5)  naᴅar-tu ʔɪla ʔs-samʔ f-**ʔɪða** ʔal-qamar-u muᴅiʔ

> look-I to the-sky f-if the-moon-NOM light
> 
> ‘I looked up to the sky, and suddenly I realized that the moon is
> lighting,’

From a semantic perspective, two syncretic forms emerge, and they have
different interpretations. The former indicates that *if* is used as an
element for building complex structures. The later indicates that *if*
is used as an element to reflect the attitude of the speaker toward the
sudden realization of what comes after *if*. This study examines the
syntactic conditions that license the use of conditional particles as
markers of expressing speakers' attitudes.
